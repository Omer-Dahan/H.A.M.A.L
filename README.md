## 📋 Overlay
**H.A.M.A.L** is a powerful desktop application designed to centralize the management of your Python automation scripts. Whether you run Telegram bots, data scrapers, or background workers, HAMAL provides a unified interface to control, monitor, and debug them all.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🚀 **Process Control** | Start, stop, and restart any script with a single click. |
| 📊 **Live Monitoring** | Real-time status tracking (Running, Stopped, Crashed). |
| 📝 **Log Streaming** | View live stdout/stderr logs for each process instantly. |
